## Prediction of data science salaries based on multivariable regressive analysis

Our ambition is to make a linear regression model with the target variable being salary range in the data science industry in the US. 
We wished to make a model relevant to ourselves and our class though there was incomplete data available for the German market. Therefore, we chose a Kaggle dataset derived from data scraping job postings from the US market from the Glassdoor site.
This was the most insightful dataset we found as it comprises company data along with skill reequirements,experience necessary etc for the job posting. 
Our model can be used by job candidates to negotiate a salary at market rate where no salary range is provided in the advert - ensuring they get the best wage for their skillset.

Our dataset has 742 rows, meaning 742 different job postings and 42 columns, meaning 42 different features, some of which we are going to use to predict salary.
